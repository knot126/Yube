# Yube

This is the repo for Yube, a video ceration and general social site. I'm not sure if it will ever become real.

Currently this is just a draft version of the software which is also assisting learning web development and video streaming.

## Ideas

Don't feel bad if you steal any ideas from here for your own site! It's fine :)

### Community moderation

It's very hard to moderate a site. I want to have some way where users can moderate the site (at least partially), but we need to decide how to do that without having bad moderation.

### Mixed content posts

I want some way to mix content post types: new videos, longer blog posts, art canvases and short microblogs. A twitter-like feed for the user page might be the best option.

### Use filesystem as database

This makes searching harder, but this is something game engines already do. Maybe it will work for us. :)

### Always use APIs and AJAX

Just have one interface for everything, and have it be a very responsive interface. (Interface = both API and GUI)
